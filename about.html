<body> <h1> About Me: My Beginnings with Brazil </h1>
	<p> <h2> My interest in Brazil started through music. </p>
		<p> The first time I heard Samba, a Brazilian music genre, was in the French film, <i> Samba </i>. The song "Take it Easy My Brother Charles" by Jorge Ben Jor was played in the movie. Once I heard Samba I started to explore other genres of Brazilian music such as <a href="file:///C:/Users/Fatima%20Coulibaly/Desktop/Web%20Fundamentals/BossaNova.html"> Bossa Nova </a>, Musica Populara Brasileria (MPB), Pagode, and others forms of music. From that moment on, I developed an interest in not only Brazilian music, but the culture too. </p> </h2>

		<p> <h2> In the future, I hope to travel to Salvadaor Da Bahia, Brazil. Traveling meanss a lot to me. It gives me the opportunity to go outside of my comfort zone and engage with a different culture. This also challlenges my way of thinking. </p>
		<p> But in the meantime, I'm practicing my Portugues and learning as much as I can about Brazilian culture. While doing so, I want to share my knowledge and thoughts with everyone. </p>
		<p> My Interests: <ul>
			<li> Brazil </li>
			<li> Visual Arts </li>
			<li> Web Design / Coding </li>
			<li> Learning New Langauges </li>
			<li> Travel </li>
			<li> Music </li>
