<h1> About Me: My Beginnings with Brazil
</h1>

<p>
	<h2> My interest in Brazil started through music.
</p>

<p>
	The first time I heard Samba, a Brazilian music genre, was in the French film, <i> Samba </i>. The song "Take it Easy My Brother Charles" by Jorge Ben Jor was played in the movie. Once I heard Samba I started to explore other genres of Brazilian music such as <a href="file:///C:/Users/Fatima%20Coulibaly/Desktop/Web%20Fundamentals/Brazilian%20Website/BossaNova.html"> Bossa Nova </a>, Musica Populara Brasileria (MPB), Pagode, and others forms of music. From that moment on, I developed an interest in not only Brazilian music, but the culture too.

<h2> In the future, I hope to travel to Salvadaor Da Bahia, Brazil. Traveling meanss a lot to me. It gives me the opportunity to go outside of my comfort zone and engage with a different culture. This also challlenges my way of thinking.
</p>

<p> But in the meantime, I'm practicing my Portugues and learning as much as I can about Brazilian culture. While doing so, I want to share my knowledge and thoughts with everyone.
