I enjoyed watching Marcel Camus’ film, Orfeu Negro. One of my favorite scenes from the film was the first evening scene of Carnaval. I thought this part was beautiful because it captured the joy of the people in the neighborhood. The dances, costumes, energy, and gleeful expressions made this part very heartwarming. I felt engaged with the scene that I watching. The rhythm of the percussions and the energetic dancing, was one the reasons I liked this scene. I’ve only seen a few short clips of Carnaval, but this scene helped me understand the social impact of the festival.

For a moment people could escape from their problems and not worry about tomorrow. Carnaval gave people the chance to be in the present and enjoy it. For example, Eurydice was trying to run away from a man who wanted to kill her, but on the first day of Carnaval, she was able to still have fun, even if it was for a small moment. Eurydice was allowed to be free and happy. The joy on her face was extremely evident as she and Orpheus danced, it was a special moment for them. Orpheus and Eurydice's tragic ending reinforces the importance of this scene because it’s one of the few moments that they have together before they die.
</p>

<p>
Orpheus’ fiance, Mira, was able to put her jealousy aside (for a short time) and dance. During this scene the camera would occasionally flip back to her, and the audience would see her singing and dancing. Despite the issues she had with Orpheus and Eurydice she genuinely looked happy. From this whole scene at Carnaval, I was able to see a whole communidade come together and have fun.
</p>

<p>
The song, “O Nosso Amor” by Antônio Carlos Jobim, was another part that I liked about this scene. In different parts of the film the communidade sings this song, when they’re celebrating Carnaval. As they sing, the joy is undeniably heard through their voices. Community is one of the important topics in this film. It was nice to see a festival bring together a whole neighborhood for a celebration. It’s also interesting that at the end of the film, we see this same neighborhood in chaos, which contrasts against the peace and harmony from the beginning of the film. Eurydice and Orpheus’ death and the disarray of the community are things that audience won’t expect to see at the start of the film.
</p>

<p>
	I was surprised that both Orpheus and Eurydice died at the end and the way that they died. I assumed someone was going to get killed but I didn’t think it would be both of them. It was devastating to see Eurydice accidently killed by her lover, who was trying to save her from death. This made Eurydice death shocking and heartbreaking to me because Orpheus loved her, but he was the one who killed her, not the man in the skeleton custom.
